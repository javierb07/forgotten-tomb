  storyText: "All of you rush to the exit, as best you can. The old healer is not
    as fast, and you see her get swarmed and buried in the grotesque bodies of the
    orcs. No thing that can be done, you think to yourself, not slowing down one bit.
    In your hurry you lose your way, and end up in a large room that seems like a
    dead end. The knight gently drops the wizard on the floor, the rogue starts to
    look for a way out, while the barbarian closes the door and holds it with his
    big body.\r\nWould you be able to leave this accursed place with the riches you
    came here for? Would you even take your life outside the place?\r\n\r\nPress 1
    to find out. 2 to go back."

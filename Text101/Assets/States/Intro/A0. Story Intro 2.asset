  storyText: "This is a disaster. Everything was going smoothly, only a few easy traps
    and minor dangers in the tomb. Made you think why everyone was afraid of the place.
    Alas, all took a turn for the worse the moment you lift the Lamp of Desire, the
    powerful artifact said to fulfill wishes, the device that changed history by making
    kings, flattening mountains and more. It was like they were waiting for you to
    take it. They came like a flood, from every direction. But it would still have
    been possible if it not were for the dark demon. The massive beast roared so hard
    that parts of the floor and wall started flying, one of them hit the wizard in
    his guts, a moment later he was motionless on the floor. Quickly the knight knelt
    beside him and lift him up like he weighed nothing, the barbarian tore apart an
    orc with his axe and roared \"WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!\".\r\n\r\nPress 1 to
    continue. 2 to go back."

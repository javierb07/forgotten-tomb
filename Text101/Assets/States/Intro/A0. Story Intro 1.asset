  storyText: "This was a mistake. You entered seeking glory, fame, secrets, treasures...
    and now it seems that you will be lucky if you leave this wretched place with
    your life. Five companions embarked in this quest with you: a muscular, big barbarian
    from the icy planes of the North; a young knight, the hint of a beard forming
    in his childish face; a sickly, small wizard with pale skin and long dark hair...
    who despite appearances you know is the most dangerous of all; an old but stark
    woman, masterful in the healing arts,... and finally her, a stunning rogue, her
    blond hair floating around, following her when she walked... and what walk she
    had, all of them turned when she moved, her hips rocking in an hypnotic dance.
    Such a woman knows that she has far better weapons than a sharp dagger.\r\n\r\nPress
    1 to continue. 2 to go back.\r"

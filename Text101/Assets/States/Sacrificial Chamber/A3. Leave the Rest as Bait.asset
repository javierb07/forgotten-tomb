  storyText: "You can only listen the sweet tones of her voice, how could such beautiful
    red lips produce anything evil. She is right, the rest are already dead; it is
    a question if you will follow them to the grave. You decide you are not going
    to let that happen. You go through the exit, the sound of fight suddenly dying.
    Outside, she screams with joy and throws her arms around you, kissing you passionately.
    \"We've made it! Now give me the lamp dear! A little too eager, but then again
    you are both e\rxcited to be out of that place. With the Lamp and your lifes!\n\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n1. Give her the lamp.\r\n2. Hold on to the lamp.\r"

  m_Name: A3. Give a Hand to the Rogue
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "You rush to the rogue; she is struggling to move a big rock form a half
    open exit. \"Give me a hand darling, for someone as strong as you this should
    be a piece of cake\", she says fluttering her eyelashes; seductive even now. You
    use every muscle fiber in your body, thinking you will be rip apart, and finally
    the rock budges enough for you to squeeze through. She giggles, \"well done love!
    Let's leave. Just you and me, the monsters will follow us otherwise.\".\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n1. Ask the rest to follow you through the exit and risk all.\r\n2.
    Leave them, they can't be saved anyway and it's your only chance.\r"

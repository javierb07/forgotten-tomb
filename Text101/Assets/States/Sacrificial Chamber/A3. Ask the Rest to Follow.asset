  storyText: "\"We can't leave them!\", you tell her. \"I just wanted to be with you\",
    a pout on her face, an innocent expression. You forgot that she suggested to leave
    everybody to die in an instant. \"We found the exit! Quickly, come this way!\".
    The knight comes rushing, the rogue already through. \"I'll hold them off! It's
    the barbarian, closing the exit behind you. Outside, the rogue screams with happiness,
    throwing her arms around your neck and kisses you. \"We've made it! Give me the
    lamp dear\", she says. \"Wait, you can't trust her. I heard her wanting to leave
    us behind!\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Give the lamp to the rogue, she has done
    nothing wrong.\n2. Hold on to the lamp, you have seen its powers and they suit
    you fine."

  storyText: "You grab the Lamp of Desire with no idea how to use it. You rub it,
    you make wishes, you try to spill its content on the wizard... when you are about
    to give up thinking that nothing's happening the wizard open his eyes; he swiftly
    gets up, the air shimmering around him. At the same time the door brakes, the
    orcs and the dark monster coming across the new formed hole in the wall. \"I can
    get us out of here, give me the lamp\" says the wizard.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1.
    Give the Lamp to the wizard. \r\n2. Keep the Lamp to yourself.\r"

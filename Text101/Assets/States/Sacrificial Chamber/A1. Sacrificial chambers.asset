  storyText: "The wizard has been hurt and lays unconscious on the floor. Next to
    him, the knight is trying his best to patch him; the healer is gone. \u201CWhy
    did I agree to come to this place?\u201D, you murmur. The barbarian is attempting
    to secure the door, and the rogue, her slender figure illuminated by the light
    of the torch, is looking for a way out of the room.\r\nSuddenly, you hear them
    banging the door and the barbarian shouts, \u201Cthis is not going to hold for
    long!\u201D. The young knight looks at you, and with imploring eyes asks \u201Chelp
    him, he\u2019s dying!\u201D. Almost at the same time the rogue says, \u201Chere,
    I think I\u2019ve found the exit. Give me a hand!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?
    \r\n1. Try to help the wizard, he's powers would make all the difference.\n2.
    Check the exit that the rogue has found; it could be your way out.\n3. Help the
    barbarian secure the door; you need more time.\n"

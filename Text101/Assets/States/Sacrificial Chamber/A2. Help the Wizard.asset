  storyText: "You kneel next to the wizard and the knight. The young lad has tears
    in his eyes, his composure gone. He's pressing a dirty rag against the open wound
    in the belly of the wizard. Blood oozing from the deep cut... to save the wizard
    you'd need a miracle... perhaps if you use the very thing that you came in for
    you could save him. The Lamp of Desire. But if you did, why did you came in for?
    With the power of the Lamp spent you'd leave only with trinkets. Should you tell
    the knight that the wizard is gone and get him to help the barbarian in securing
    the door? Or perhaps use the artifact to save the wizard; his powers might be
    the only thing to get you out alive.\n\r\nWhat do you want to do?\r\n\r\n1. Use
    the Lamp of Desire to heal the wizard.\n2. Tell the knight that the wizard is
    gone and ask him to help the barbarian."

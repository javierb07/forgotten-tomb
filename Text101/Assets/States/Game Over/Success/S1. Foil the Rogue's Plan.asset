  storyText: "You hold the Lamp tightly. \"What's the rush? I can keep it for a while\",
    you tell her in response. \"Fool, you don't know what you have in your hands!\",
    she tells you, desperation in her voice, \"give it to me now!\". She comes forward
    and you start to struggle, noticing that she has a dagger in her hand. It is thanks
    to the knight that you can get her off. You bound her, her hair now a mess and
    her face red with anger. \"Let's go back to town, enough blood was spilled today\",
    says the knight. \"You are right\", you answer. You look at the rogue but she
    doesn\u2019t meet your eyes.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue.\r"

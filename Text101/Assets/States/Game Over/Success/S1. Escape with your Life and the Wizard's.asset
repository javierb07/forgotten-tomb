  storyText: "You give the Lamp to the wizard. \"Come close to me!\", he shouts. Knight
    and barbarian rush to the wizard. You look around for the rogue but she has already
    disappeared. The door explodes, orcs pouring from the hole it left. You have a
    chance to glance at the dark devil before the wizard is done with his spell and
    teleports you out.\r\nYou are back in the entrance to the tomb, the power of the
    teleportation having destroyed the way in to the place. Maybe for the better.
    \"The Lamp is now useless, but we have our lifes\" says the wizard. \"The rogue,
    she's trapped inside!\", you say but nobody is in a rush to enter again to save
    her.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue.\r"

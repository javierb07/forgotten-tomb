  storyText: "\"I think you are too eager to have this, we've just let our companions
    die!\", you say to her with sadness. \"But we are alive, and I need that. You
    are going to give it to me now. One way or the other.\" She launches quickly at
    you, a blond-headed blur. You struggle and fall to the floor, and notice that
    she has her dagger in her hand. Eventually, the fighting ends when her own blade
    finds its way somehow to her hart in the fight. Blood spills from her mouth, she
    tries to say something but she can't. \"I'm sorry...\", you apologize but she
    is already dead.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue. \r"

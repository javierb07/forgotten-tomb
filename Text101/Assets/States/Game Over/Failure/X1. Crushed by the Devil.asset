  storyText: "As you make your way to the barbarian you come to a sudden halt: an
    enormous sword comes from the muscular belly of the barbarian, piercing both door
    and man without effort. The world freezes for a moment and then the door explodes
    in a million pieces, pushing you to the ground. You have barely enough force to
    lift your head a little to see scores of orcs pouring through the hole where the
    door used to be. The dark devil lunges forth, in its grotesque disgusting member
    he holds the piece of slab that stabbed the barbarian. The creature looks at you
    with its red blood eyes. Its black fur covered in blood. It leaps the space that
    separates you in a matter of an instant and crushes you with its weight. You are
    dead.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue."

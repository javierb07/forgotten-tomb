  storyText: "The knight, tears rolling down his face nods and gets up. His knuckles
    white with the strength of holding his sword. You look back and cannot see the
    rogue anymore. The barbarian has barely enough time to step back from the door,
    as it explodes with a rain of both debris and orcs. Your weapons sing for a few
    moments, the corpses of your enemies piling up around you. Eventually, their numbers
    are too much and you are buried with the filth and stench of the orcs. The last
    you see is the dark creature, its red eyes, black horns, and dark fur... maybe
    a smile on its face.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to continue."

  storyText: "You decide that the Lamp is too valuable and that you rather keep it
    to yourself. \"I think I'll hold on to this\", you say. \"Fool, it's our only
    way out!\", the wizard shouts, but it is now too late. The orcs and the dark monster
    burst through the hole. Barbarian and knight do their best and hack down many
    orcs. But the dark devil is the real menace; swiftly it comes to the warriors
    and kills them with its enormous sword. The rogue is nowhere to be seen. The wizard
    casts a powerful spell; it removes almost half of the upper torso of the monster.
    But it still has enough strength to swing the sword one last time, cutting the
    wizard in half. Everyone else is dead, as you stay paralyzed while the corpse
    of the devil falls and buries you. You don't die instantly, but rather from the
    lack of air caused by the stench and weight of the monster over you.\r\n\nPress
    1 to continue.\r\n"
